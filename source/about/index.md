**Welcome to My Blog!**

Hi there! I'm thrilled to have you here. This blog is my little corner of the internet where I share:

1. **[Editorials for Codeforces and LeetCode Questions](/edits)**  
   As a passionate problem-solver, I love tackling challenging coding problems. Here, you'll find detailed editorials, solutions, and insights into competitive programming questions that I’ve worked on.

2. **[Personal Experiences and Stories](/blogs)**  
   From academic and professional milestones to lessons learned and everyday adventures, I'll be sharing experiences that have shaped who I am.

This blog is more than just a collection of posts — it's a space for learning, growth, and connection. I hope you find something here that resonates with you.

Feel free to explore, engage, and share your thoughts. Thanks for stopping by!
