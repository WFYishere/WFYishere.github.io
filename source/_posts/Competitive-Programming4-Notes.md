Notes for [Competitive Programming 4](https://cpbook.net/). A very good book.

# Foreword

This post are some notes that I have taken from the book CP4. Do note that it is much better if you read the book by yourself and these are just study notes that I have made. I didn't make notes for all chapters, and the arrangement of this study note might be different from the ordering of chapters in the book. I have also included my study plan at the end of the post.
