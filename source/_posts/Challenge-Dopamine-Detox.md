Day 1: I didn't use any digital device until 4pm. However, since I started using it, it becomes incredibly difficult to stop. Also, during the 4 horus, it was much more productive than before. I did about 2 hours of work and I didn't feel very tired. However, I did feel very drown to using my phone etc.
